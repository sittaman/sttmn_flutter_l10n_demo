It is the largest natural satellite of a planet in the solar system relative to the size of its primary body, with 27% of the diameter and 60% of the density of the Earth. Among satellites whose density is known, the Moon is the second densest, behind Io. The formation of the Moon is estimated to have occurred about 4.51 billion years ago, relatively shortly after the formation of the Earth. Although several hypotheses have been proposed in the past for its origin, the most consensual explanation currently is that the Moon was formed from the debris of a gigantic impact between the Earth and another body the size of Mars.\n\nThe Moon is in synchronous rotation with the Earth, always showing the same visible face, marked by dark volcanic seas between crystalline mountains and prominent impact craters. It is the second brightest object in the sky after the Sun, although its surface is actually dark, with a reflectance slightly above that of asphalt. Its prominence in the sky and its regular cycle of phases have made the Moon an important cultural reference in language, calendars, art, and mythology since ancient times. The influence of the Moon's gravity is responsible for ocean tides and the increase in Earth's sidereal day. Its current orbital distance, about thirty times the diameter of the Earth, makes the satellite appear to be the same size as the Sun in the sky, allowing it to completely cover it during a total solar eclipse.\n\nThe Moon is the only celestial body beyond Earth on which humans have set foot. The Soviet Union's Luna program was the first to reach the Moon with unmanned probes in 1959. The United States government's Apollo program enabled the only manned missions to the satellite to date, from the first manned voyage in 1968 by Apollo 8, to six manned landings between 1969 and 1972, the first of which was Apollo 11. These missions collected more than 380 kilograms of lunar rocks that have been used in the study of the Moon's origin, geological history, and internal structure."
